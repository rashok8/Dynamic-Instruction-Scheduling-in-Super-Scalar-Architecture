# Dynamic-Instruction-Scheduling-in-Super-Scalar-Architecture
 Modelled an out of order instruction execution simulator to exploit Instruction Level Parallelism employing Tomasulo Algorithm â€“ Register Renaming, Out of Order Execution and Branch Prediction techniques. Enabled configurable superscalar width and dynamic instruction issue up to N instructions per cycle.
